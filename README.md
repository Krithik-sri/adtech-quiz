## Description

This is just a space war type diy game with rouge like mechanics. The only difference is that the r&g is completely based on the mcq's and the answers user give them.

I put a lot of tiny details related to adtech in the game and I hope you enjoy it.

## Run Locally

1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` in [.env.local](.env.local) to your Gemini API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`


P.S I used gemini studio to create the game cus its way too much of a hassle to do it manually
